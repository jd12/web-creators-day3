Web Creators Day 3 Challenge

You are going to continue working on your "JavaJam" website. You are going to use CSS to style the page. 

The [index.png](indexWithCSS.png) page will give you the colors needed to style. 

Take a look at the [music.png](music.png) file as a guide on how to tweak your music page. and make sure to link all of your pages to your new CSS stylesheet.  

Note that the performer links are external urls. include:  target="_blank" in the anchor tag
so that the performer link opens in a new window. [Here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp) goes instructions on how to do that.
